Rust! <img src="https://simpleicons.org/icons/rust.svg" height="16"> I am a novice Rustacean -- and I'm capable of creating various types of simple, safe applications in Rust! Due to Rust's explicit error handling, my Rust apps should be rock-solid stable and super speedy due to Rust's compiler!.. but I'm not that good at Rust yet so we'll have to wait and see 😅

My latest Rust adventure? [I made a fast command-line utility to easily download files from the web similar to Curl!](https://github.com/T-O-R-U-S/quickdl)

If what you search for is some less *fringe* Rust use, then you should look forward to my next Rust adventure!
